title: A quiet place
---
<p>I watched the world die out, and all I could think about was you.<br>
There was no brokenness, nor false shedding of your hair.<br>
Not so close, not so far.<br>
And as deep as it is tall, you'll always lie down the same<br>
With your jaw clenched, with your innards out.<br>
Is it yours still?<br>
Because no ownership would suit you, no metric defines eternals.<br>
No, <br>

Fiction is but a tool here, I wrap my whole worlds around you.<br>
I saw it through your own smile,<br>

I was never meant to leave this place.
